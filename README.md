# BooksStore-App
This is a Book storing application that is completed using React.js, Node.js, MongoDB, and Tailwind CSS with the support of Postman.
I did it to study React.js and Node.js. 
This is not my project and I completed it with the support of a YouTube video posted by a channel called Raddy
